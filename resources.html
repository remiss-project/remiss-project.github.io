										<h4>Pilots</h4>
										<p> To be published soon </p>
										<p>In this video, we present two pilot studies conducted as part of the REMISS
											project, focusing on the critical impact of disinformation during elections
											and its effects on vulnerable communities.
											The first pilot examines how
											narratives spread on social media during election periods, shaping public
											opinion and fueling polarization. Specifically, we focus on: The
											Barcelona municipal elections (2019), The Generalitat de Catalunya regional
											elections (2021), The Andalusia regional elections (2022), and The General
											elections (2019).
											The second pilot addresses the challenges faced by vulnerable groups,
											such as refugees, with a particular focus on three key news stories that
											emerged during the project: Open Arms and MENA criminalisation campaigns.
											Both pilots showcase innovative approaches to detecting, analyzing, and
											mitigating the spread of disinformation, offering valuable insights for
											policymakers and the general public alike.
